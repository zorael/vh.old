/**
   Reads by line in an efficient way (10 times faster than File.byLine from std.stdio).
   This is accomplished by reading entire buffers (fgetc() is not used),
   and allocating as little as possible.
   The char \n is considered as separator, removing the previous \r if it exists.
   The \n is never returned. The \r is not returned if it was
   part of a \r\n (but it is returned if it was by itself).
   The returned string is always a substring of a temporary
   buffer, that must not be stored. If necessary, you must
   use str[] or .dup or .idup to copy to another string.
   Example:
   File f = File("file.txt");
   foreach (string line; ByLineFast(f)) {
       ...process line...
       //Make a copy:
       string copy = line[];
   }
   The file isn't closed when done iterating, unless it was the only reference to
   the file (same as std.stdio.byLine). (example: ByLineFast(File("file.txt"))).
